# Guided Reflection: Variables in Scratch

### Instructions:
Take the next 30 minutes to reflect on last week’s class with Sheikh Salim. Answer the following questions thoughtfully and in complete sentences (2-4 sentences per question). This reflection will help me understand what you learned, what you found interesting, and what challenges you faced during the lesson. Don't worry if you are unsure of any of these questions, please do your best explaining from your own understanding of each concept. Submit your completed reflection by the end of the 30 minutes.

## Part 1: Understanding Variables

1. **What are variables in Scratch?**  
   - Explain what a variable is and why it’s important in programming. Use your own words.
  


2. **What types of information can variables store?**  
   - Think about the examples given in class (e.g., scores, sizes, or other values). From your understanding what infromation can variables store?
  


3. **What are the steps to create a variable in Scratch?**  
   - Describe how to create a variable. Include what you need to name it and the options you can choose (e.g., global or local variables).

## Part 2: Reflecting on Concepts

4. **What is the difference between setting a variable and changing a variable?**  
   - Explain these two actions. Think about examples like setting a score to 0 versus increasing a score.




5. **What was the most interesting thing you learned about variables?**  
   - Share what caught your attention or what you found exciting about using variables in Scratch.




6. **What was the most confusing part about variables?**  
   - Was there something that didn’t make sense or felt tricky to understand? Write it down so we can review it together.

## Part 3: Applying Variables

7. **How might variables be useful in a Scratch project?**  
   - Imagine a game, animation, or story you could create. Write a few sentences about how you might use variables in your project.




8. **What is one question you still have about variables?**  
   - Write down something you’re curious about or want to understand better. (If you don't have anything that comes to mind mention that as well).




9. **Rate your confidence with variables so far (1-5):**  
   - 1 = Not confident at all, 5 = Very confident. Explain your rating.




10. **What are you looking forward to learning next about Scratch?**  
   - Is there anything that we have not learned in Scratch that you would like to learn?

## Optional Challenge (If You Finish Early)
If you complete the reflection early, think about a game or animation idea that could use at least two variables. Write a brief description of your idea and explain how those variables would work.
